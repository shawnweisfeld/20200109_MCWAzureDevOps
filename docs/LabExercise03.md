## Exercise 3: Create Azure DevOps build pipeline

Duration: 15 Minutes

Implementing CI and CD pipelines helps to ensure consistent and quality code that's readily available to users. Azure Pipelines is a quick, easy, and safe way to automate building your projects and making them available to users,

In this exercise, you will create a build definition using, Azure Pipelines, that will automatically build the web application with every commit of source code. This will lay the groundwork for us to then create a release pipeline for publishing the code to our Azure environments.
  
### Task 1: Create a build pipeline

Pipelines are made of one or more stages describing a CI/CD process. Stages are the major divisions in a pipeline: "build this app", "run these tests", and "deploy to pre-production" are good examples of stages.

Stages consist of one or more jobs, which are units of work assignable to a particular machine. Both stages and jobs may be arranged into dependency graphs: "run this stages before that one" or "this job depends on the output of that job".

Jobs consist of a linear series of steps. Steps can be tasks, scripts, or references to external templates.

This hierarchy is reflected in the structure of a YAML file.

1.  In your Azure DevOps project, select the Pipelines menu option from the left-hand navigation.

    ![In the Azure DevOps window, Pipelines is highlighted in the ribbon.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image68.png "Azure DevOps window")

2.  Select the **New pipeline** button to create a new build pipeline.

    ![In Builds, New pipeline is highlighted.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image69.png "Create a new pipeline")

3.  This starts a wizard where you'll first need to select where your current code is located. In a previous step, you pushed code up to Azure Repos. Select the **Azure Repos Git** option.

    ![A screen that shows choosing the Azure Repos option for the TailspinToys project.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image70.png "Where is your code?")

4.  Next, you'll need to select the specific repository where your code was pushed. In a previous step, you pushed it to the **TailspinToys** repository. Select the **TailspinToys** git repository.

    ![A screen that shows choosing the TailspinToys repository.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image71.png "Select a repository")

5.  Then, you'll need to select the type of pipeline to configure. Although this pipeline contains a mix of technologies, select **ASP.NET Core** from the list of options.

    ![A screen that shows choosing ASP.NET Core pipeline.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image72.png "Configure your pipeline")

6.  As a final step in the creation of a build pipeline, you are presented with a configured pipeline in the form of an azure-pipelines.yml file. 
   
7.  This starter YAML file contains a few lines of instructions (shown below) for the pipeline. Let's begin by updating the YAML with more specific instructions to build our application. 

    ![A screen that shows the starter pipeline YAML.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image72a.png "Review your pipeline YAML")

The "pool" section specifies which pool to use for a job of the pipeline. It also holds information about the job's strategy for running.

8.  Select and replace the "pool" section with the following code:

    ```yml
    pool:
      name: Hosted VS2017
      demands:
      - msbuild
      - visualstudio
      - vstest
    ```

Steps are a linear sequence of operations that make up a job. Each step runs in its own process on an agent and has access to the pipeline workspace on disk. This means environment variables are not preserved between steps but, file system changes are.

9.  Select and replace the "steps" section with the following code:
    
    ```yml
    steps:
    - task: NuGetToolInstaller@0
      displayName: 'Use NuGet 4.4.1'
      inputs:
        versionSpec: 4.4.1
    ```

Tasks are the building blocks of a pipeline. They describe the actions that are performed in sequence during an execution of the pipeline.

1.  Add this to the bottom of the YAML file to the "task" section:
    
    >**Note**: The YAML below creates individual tasks for performing all the necessary steps to build and test our application along with publishing the artifacts inside Azure DevOps so they can be retrieved during the upcoming release pipeline process.

    ```yaml
    - task: UseNode@1
      inputs:
        checkLatest: true

    - task: NuGetCommand@2
      displayName: 'NuGet restore'
      inputs:
        restoreSolution: '**\tailspintoysweb.csproj'

    - task: VSBuild@1
      displayName: 'Build solution'
      inputs:
        solution: '**\tailspintoysweb.csproj'
        msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\\"'
        platform: 'any cpu'
        configuration: 'release'

    - task: PublishSymbols@2
      displayName: 'Publish symbols path'
      inputs:
        SearchPattern: '**\bin\**\*.pdb'
        PublishSymbols: false
      continueOnError: true

    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
      displayName: 'Publish Artifact'
      inputs:
        PathtoPublish: '$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)'
        ArtifactName: 'TailspinToys-CI'
      condition: succeededOrFailed()
    ```

2.  The final result will look like the following:

    ```yml
    # ASP.NET Core
    # Build and test ASP.NET Core projects targeting .NET Core.
    # Add steps that run tests, create a NuGet package, deploy, and more:
    # https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/dotnet-core

    trigger:
    - master

    pool:
    name: Hosted VS2017
    demands:
    - msbuild
    - visualstudio
    - vstest

    variables:
      buildConfiguration: 'Release'

    steps:
    - task: NuGetToolInstaller@0
    displayName: 'Use NuGet 4.4.1'
    inputs:
      versionSpec: 4.4.1

    - task: UseNode@1
    inputs:
      checkLatest: true

    - task: NuGetCommand@2
    displayName: 'NuGet restore'
    inputs:
      restoreSolution: '**\tailspintoysweb.csproj'

    - task: VSBuild@1
    displayName: 'Build solution'
    inputs:
      solution: '**\tailspintoysweb.csproj'
      msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\\"'
      platform: 'any cpu'
      configuration: 'release'

    - task: PublishSymbols@2
    displayName: 'Publish symbols path'
    inputs:
      SearchPattern: '**\bin\**\*.pdb'
      PublishSymbols: false
    continueOnError: true

    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
    displayName: 'Publish Artifact'
    inputs:
      PathtoPublish: '$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)'
      ArtifactName: 'TailspinToys-CI'
    condition: succeededOrFailed()
    ```

3.  Choose the **Save and run** button to save our new pipeline and also kick off the first build.

    ![A screen that shows the contents of azure-pipelines.yml. The Save and run button is highlighted.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image73.png "azure-pipelines.yml")    

4.  The new azure-pipelines.yml file will automatically be added to the root of your TailspinToys repository. This is done through a git commit that Azure DevOps facilitates. You are then asked to enter a commit description. By default, it will be populated for you. Once again, select the **Save and run** button at the bottom of the screen.

    ![A screen that shows the commit of azure-pipelines.yml. The Save and run button is highlighted.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image74.png "Save and run")   

5.  The build process will immediately begin and run through the steps defined in the azure-pipelines.yml file. Your Azure DevOps screen will refresh to show you the build process executing, in real-time. 

    ![A screen that shows the real-time output of the build process.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image76.png "Real-time output")   

6.   After the build process completes, you should see a green check mark next to each of the build pipeline steps.
  
  ![A screen that shows a successfully completed build pipeline.](./assets/lab-images/stepbystep/media/image77.png "Success") 
    
  Congratulations! You have just created your first build pipeline. In the next exercise, we will create a release pipeline that deploys your successful builds.
